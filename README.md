## API Endpoints

### Public Routes
- `GET /` - Main login page
- `GET /admin` - Admin login page
- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `GET /question` - Get current active question
- `POST /replies` - Submit user answer

### Admin Routes (require admin password)
- `POST /admin/login` - Admin authentication
- `POST /admin/users` - Create new user
- `GET /admin/users` - Get all users
- `DELETE /admin/users/:userId` - Delete user
- `POST /admin/question` - Update current question

## Database Schema

### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  password: String,
  created_at: Date
}
```

### Questions Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  question: String,
  is_active: Boolean,
  created_at: Date
}
```

### Replies Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  userPassword: String,
  userName: String,
  questionId: ObjectId (ref: Question),
  question: String,
  reply: String,
  created_at: Date
}
```

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:5000`

## Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for Vercel deployment with the included `vercel.json` file.

### Deploy Steps:
1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the configuration and deploy
4. Your app will be available at your Vercel domain

### Environment Variables
The MongoDB connection string is currently hardcoded. For production, consider using environment variables:

1. Add `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
2. Update `server.js` to use:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || "your-fallback-connection-string")
   ```

## Security Notes

- Admin password is hardcoded as `khurram@uetksk`
- User passwords are stored as plain text (consider hashing for production)
- No rate limiting implemented
- Consider adding HTTPS enforcement for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Server not starting**: Check if port 5000 is available
2. **Database connection fails**: Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string
3. **Admin panel not accessible**: Ensure you're using the correct password
4. **Users can't login**: Verify users are created through admin panel

### Deployment Issues:
1. **Build fails on Vercel**: Check `package.json` dependencies
2. **Database connection fails**: Verify MongoDB Atlas allows connections from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
3. **Static files not loading**: Ensure all files are committed to repository
